## 2015 History - One Codebase to rule Android, iOS and Windows Phone

With Maji Mobile, Kabisa has open sourced in 2015 a mobile platform development solution.

The solution was a composition of Apache Cordova with BackboneJS and MarionetteJS.

Apache Cordova provides the possibility to translate web technologies to Android, IOS and Windows Phone.

BackboneJS and MarionetteJS are both frontend tools and back in 2015 were the most mature frameworks to use.

ReactNative was released in 2015, Ionic was already released in 2013 and used a combination of Apache Cordova and AngularJs

## 2020 - One Codebase to rule Android, iOS and ~~Windows Phone~~ Web

Fast forward, we have seen React to become widely adopted for frontend development, which succeeded BackboneJs and MarionetteJS in our maji mobile stack.

A problem with the Maji Stack is, that mobile apps do not feel like a native app for customers. That is not suprising, since we are trying to mimic

the native behaviour of components, rebuild in html and css. There are CSS frameworks that try their best to add styles for Android and iOS.

## Flutter

First announced and released in the beginning of 2017, Flutter is:

> "Googleâ€™s UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications
> for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase."
